    <h2>Web Dev Concepts</h2>
    <p>The Index file concerning 'Websites' is the main page or default page that any given server will display for the user if their request does not specify a page in their request. The Index file concerning 'Servers' is the main or default file that the Server sends to the user when no specific file is specified in their request.</p>
    <p>When a user opens the ‘index.html’ file locally, one will notice that the file path will be displayed through the URL Bar and the ‘Sources’ tab. One will also not see HTTP(S) headers, since this file isn’t being delivered through the web. When a user opens the ‘index.html’ through the web server, we will immediately see the differences within the inspector tool window. The Server Domain will be displayed within the ‘Sources’ tab. The difference that we will see under the ‘Network’ tab would be that one will see 2 additional objects: 1.) an executor.js script and 2.) a favicon.ico icon file. Additionally, instead of seeing the ‘index.html’ file, one would see on the local display, one would see the following document file ‘a1-username’ displayed.</p>
    <p>The favicon.ico file returned a status of 200, meaning that the server has found the favicon.ico file and returned it to the user. Since it may be deduced that the file was not placed by the creator of the index.html, the hosting server automatically added the favicon.ico file. While the main.js and main.css files returned a status of 404 because the files are not present in the directory. We expect the latter two files to have the ‘Not Found’ status, as they were not placed in the directory initially.</p>
    <p>The scheme will identify the protocol that will need to be used to access this web page (‘https’). The subdomain is the subset of the original domain. This is used to better navigate the different sections of the website (‘web.engr’). The host domain is the main location in which the website is hosted (‘oregonstate.edu’). The resources are typically used to request specific pages or contents to be displayed back to the user. In this case, the ‘/~partidju’ indicates a particular user’s directory, while the ‘a1-partidju’ indicates the specific folder within the referenced directory. When all the components are put together, the complete URL is https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~partidju/a1-partidju/.</p>
